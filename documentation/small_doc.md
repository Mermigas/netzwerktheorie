# Schallbild

Schallbild is an interactive multi-laptop installation. Through an interface you are able to generate simple waveforms, regulate its frequency and amplitude and send those signals to all available client laptops. In dependency of the generated parameters, the clients visualise the created sonic.
The setup includes the process of arranging the client laptops in a given position. In this way, each individual laptop has a local position on its display, but also knows its position in the global room. This enables the visualisation to spread on all client laptops and creates an overall images, which is able to interact with itself.
